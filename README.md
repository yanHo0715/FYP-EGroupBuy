**SmartGroup – Collaborative Group Buying Web Platform**

SmartGroup is a web-based C2C group buying platform designed to support direct buying, group buying, and bundle-based group packages.
The system focuses on improving coordination, transparency, and fairness in group buying by automating group management, order tracking, and refund handling.

This project was developed as a final-year software engineering project, informed by user questionnaires, interviews, and iterative design.
